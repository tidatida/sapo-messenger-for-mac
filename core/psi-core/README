Known Issues
------------
This is a beta (preview) version of Psi and is not intended to be release 
quality or used in production environments.  Particularly, the following 
issues are known (those issues which are believed to have originated in 
external libraries are marked with a *):
  - GnuPG is temporarily not supported.
  - Mouse actions on tabbed chat windows have been temporarily disabled.
  - Roster tooltips are a little ugly currently, more whitespace will be 
      added again later.
  - When receiving multiline messages in a chat, sometimes some lines will
      not be visible until another message is received or sent. 

Notes
-----
  - This beta release includes a patched version of QCA2. Although it is 
      possible to link against another self-patched QCA2, it is strongly 
      recommended to use the provided tree, which is now default when
      using ./configure on unices, or by default on Windows. Please ignore
      all notes regarding QCA2 plugins below.

  - Upgrading to 0.11 --
    * The last used profile settings will not be transferred from 0.10 and
      previous Qt3-based builds to the 0.11-beta1 and newer Qt4 based builds.
      If Psi loads with a blank profile, cancel the account creation and use 
     "Choose profile" to reset your default profile.	
    * When you decide to switch to Psi 0.11 permanently, you can safely clear
      the 'affinix.com' keys from your registry.
    * The PEM format is now used for storing SSL certificates.
    * You must use the QCA-OpenSSL plugin for QCA2 to utilize SSL.
      The older 'QSSL' plugin and QCA1 plugin will not work.
    * Users upgrading from pre-0.10 will not benefit from the new colour 
      scheme. If they want the new colours, they should quit Psi and edit 
      their config.xml file by hand. For details, please see the User Guide in 
      the Help menu. 
    * The WindowMaker docklet has been discontinued. We have been suffering
      problems with it since the previous release(s), it is non-standard,
      it lacks documentation, and so we decided to only support the 
      FreeDesktop.org tray. People using WindowMaker can use tools such as 
      Docker as a replacement.

  - GnuPG tips --
    * Always use the latest version of GnuPG.
    * On Windows, use a native build instead of one based on cygwin, and make
      sure it is properly installed in the registry.
    * Ensure 'gpg' actually works, by testing it from the command-line.
    * You must have a public and secret keyring.  Psi cannot operate
      without them, and they must be there when you start it.
    * If you experience fatal GnuPG incompatibilities, you can pass
      the --no-gpg option to Psi and gpg will not be used.
    * If you have gpg-agent set up, but you don't want Psi to use it, then
      you can pass --no-gpg-agent to force the use of Psi's built-in prompt.

Description
-----------

  Psi is a capable Jabber client aimed at experienced users.  Its design
  goals are simplicity and stability.  Psi is highly portable and runs on
  Windows, Unix/X11, and Mac OS X.

  The interface is very ICQ-like.  Alerts appear in the contact list when
  events are received, and things like subscriptions requests appear as
  "system messages" (ICQ users know these well).  Even "Chats" are
  queued in the contact list.  Also, chats are "remembered" by default,
  so that you don't have to keep a bunch of windows open for each person.
  Just close the chat window.  If you open it again it will all be there.

  Psi is minimal but powerful.  There are keybindings for just about
  everything, Unicode is supported throughout, and contacts are cached
  offline.  Security is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for
  both client-to-server (SSL) and client-to-client (GnuPG).

  Plans for v1.0:
   - Multi-User Chat (JEP-0045)
   - Plugin system
   - Other misc stuff
   - Bugfixes
