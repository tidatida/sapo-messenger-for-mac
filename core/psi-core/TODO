  supporting BOLD and ITALIC in jabber msges by using * and / like you do in newsgroups ..
  Licq supports replacing some %<letter>s with information on the sender of the
    message and other things. (There's a list below) IT supports these in
    OnEvent, auto responses (check status), and utilities
    For example: sound player "~/scripts/say", on message "%a has just sent you an I.C.Q. message"
      %a - user alias
      %e - email
      %f - first name
      %h - phone number
      %i - user ip
      %l - last name
      %m - # pending messages
      %n - full name
      %o - last seen online
      %O - online since
      %p - user port
      %s - full status
      %S - abbreviated status
      %u - uin
      %w - webpage
  Ability to specify an arbitrary time for chatdlgs to stay active (x minutes/hours/days)
  "small mode" - put mainwin buttons (and toolbuttons) into the cvlist right-click
  option to have sounds not play when XA (but still play when Away)
  option to have mainwin/dock status follow a specific account rather than "best choice"
  option to show status message in parenthesis to the right of the contact (like yahoo)
  ability to "auto-reconnect" to a transport?
  cv: let the user choose how the list is sorted
  Spell check
  pictures for users
  group ideas:
    option: sort or not
    choose order of groups and contacts with drag and drop
    save order on the server
    support empty groups that get removed on signoff
  Have a way of marking some people as 'important' contacts, so they will always trigger sound
  psuedo-chat support like Mirabilis ICQ / Licq (ie, split window, but still used like normal messages)
  friendlier infodlg.  get rid of those lame tabs
  maybe an XML-based skins support (not only colors, sounds, images, key \
    bindings, but also window positions, shapes, etc) \
    Microsoft Windows Media Player supports XML-based skinning.  Basically \
    this consists of a file which has a bunch of JavaScript glueing the \
    entire skin together with code, and several images for hilite graphics, \
    background graphics, alpha-map graphics, etc.  Very flexible. \
    Justin's opinion:  if you want to fork Psi to do this, be my guest..
  cvlist sorting options
    sort by group, online/offline split
    sort by group, online/offline together
    sort by group and by status
    sort by group and alphanumerically
    sort by status without groups
    sort alphanumerically without groups
      sort by online/offline
      straight alphanumerical sort
  chatdlg: optionally tabbed like GAIM?
  cvlist select multiple?
  right-clicking on status button should bring up a list of accounts, each with submenus that would set \
    the status of the chosen account.
  option to have psi remember your password for the running session
  Remember last status when psi quits (even if improperly shut down).  restore this status when psi is run again?
  if you get a msg from someone in a closed group, it should not expand the whole group
  "diskless" mode

Bugs
  connection timeouts are reported as "connection refused" (qt)
  slowdown when receiving a chat message?  or a problem with QTextEdit debug messages?

Miscellaneous
  change PsiIconSet::type2anim() to be const (and return const)
  properly sort cvlist accounts if one of them gets renamed
  class Options: cpp'ify (reset, toXml, fromXml)
  convert some of the preferences into their own classes (or lists), like fonts, colors, sounds, etc
  field for author/license information in lang packs (display in About box)
  'find' function in historydlg should show the found result in the center of 50 results, rather than the top
  Check for libqssl without needing a restart?
  finish jidlink and formalize the linktest process (<linktest xmlns="adsfasd"/>)
  replies should only close a window that it is associated with (use QGuardedPtr?)
  custombrowser, mailer, and sound player should be called as a shell command, not arg0
  don't allow send/recv of blank messages (all content is whitespace or empty)
  allow blank password entry
  don't prompt for password until actually connected.  reprompt if wrong??
  iconset: universal anim support (so eventdlg / mainwin / contactview can share) (misha?)
  proper dialog button order depending on platform
  when entering a text string into "Server to browse", any whitespace before or after is not trimmed.  lots of \
    fields like this should have some sort of auto-trim.
  when opening a new chat window of a contact with pending events, the presence is logged to the chat window \
    before the messages are, which have an earlier timestamp (looks weird)
